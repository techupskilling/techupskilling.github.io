          <p style="font-size:20px">MENTORSHIP</p>
          <br>
          <p style="color:#336799">MOOCs</p>
          <br>
          <p>An integral part of any learning process is engagement with others, and the MOOC learning process is no different. To best suit the needs of students, and with an eye to improving retention rates, effective MOOC training programs can incorporate some level of mentorship or group interaction to facilitate not only the educational process but also the practical application of the skills acquired.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Mentor-like interactions between students and their peers, as well as between students and instructors, can come in a variety of forms: from something as simple as a peer-reviewed assignment in a forum monitored by instructors, to coordinated events like virtual “office hours” with course staff (a widespread practice, especially amongst larger MOOCs).  However, they can be highly effective in increasing discussion and student engagement—the key pedagogical challenge facing MOOCs. An analysis of student evaluations of the FutureLearn MOOC platform, utilized by the UK’s Open University, found that “students welcome this approach [discussion-based peer review] and want more discussion—particularly discussions involving teachers” (Petre). Moreover, research indicates that increased interaction amongst MOOC students, their peers, and their instructors is significantly conducive to higher performance. A study of Georgetown University’s first MOOC (Globalization's Winners and Losers: Challenges for Developed and Developing Countries) found that “social student involvement was positively associated with overall student grade” (Cheung).</p>
          <br>
          <p>Dr. Charles Severance of the University of Michigan takes a novel approach to increasing student-instructor interaction in the internet history and Python programming MOOCs he teaches, travelling around the country and, indeed, around the world, to hold in-person “office hours” with his students (“Coursera IHTS”). While this model is obviously not feasible on a larger scale, it does create a unique opportunity for similar activities in localized areas—for example, a study group for those in a given city who are taking the same MOOC.</p>
          <br>
          <p>From a more career-centric point of view, it would be quite easy for instructors in programs that have been developed with the aid of industry to involve employees of their corporate partners in the virtual office hour process, giving students a direct line to those alongside whom they hope to soon work. </p>
          <br>
          <p style="color:#336799">Community Colleges</p>
          <br>
          <p>While institutional support structures should be implemented and strengthened regarding better finance, diversity affairs, and employment streamlining, mentorship relationships can be essential to increasing retention rates and student success. Mentorship programs are also unique aspects of the community college experience because they can address student needs and progress in a holistic way, better preparing mentees not only for success in completing coursework and devising a plan of study but also in directing their learning towards future career plans. </p>
          <br>
          <p>While mentorship programs can deal with everything from integrating students whose first language is not English to the transition experience of transfer students (Chen 2), students in tech programs can benefit from three specific types of mentorship services, directed: 1. towards the general student population (“Peer Mentoring Program” 1), 2. towards underrepresented minority students (Hayes 2), or 3. towards students on a specific type of learning track (e.g. technology programs) (“Women in Technology” 2). </p>
          <br>
          <p>Community colleges’ mentorship programs vary by institution, particular in terms of who serve as mentors. Some institutions, such as Jamestown Community College, rely upon fellow peers or alumni to mentor incoming students. At these colleges, mentors draw upon their own experiences to relate to and assist new students in making the best choices professionally and academically (“Peer Mentoring Program” 1). Other institutions rely upon external mentors from other companies or institutions that can look to hire graduates. Some community colleges utilize in-house community college mentors who act as academic advisors. Moraine Valley Community College utilizes both external and in-house mentors in a National Science Foundation funded mentorship program that furthers professional and academic development of students (“Women in Technology” 4-18).</p>
          <br>
          <p> Mentorship programs provide students with the increased support needed to complete their program, increase student incentive to complete programs and help to ensure student success. They benefit community colleges by increasing the resources available to students, increasing retention rates and completion rates. Likewise, they benefit students by providing a broader source of support for their professional and academic development. They also benefit the technology industry by providing them with better prepared students, and thus better hires. </p>
          <br>
          <p style="color:#336799">Coding Bootcamps</p>
          <br>
          <p>Bootcamps could be improved by standardizing and encouraging mentorship opportunities. Several coding bootcamps already rely upon mentorship programs to attract students and improve their overall experience. These mentors can help students get acclimated to the industry and connect them with contacts that may be useful in finding a job. One bootcamp that already incorporates mentorship into their program is Hack Reactor. Hack Reactor brought on a new Director of Student Outcomes in November (Hack Reactor). The director is responsible for mentoring the students about how they can turn their programming experience into a lifelong career. Some skills that Hack Reactor emphasizes to students include identifying job opportunities, practicing workplace etiquette, and maneuvering the job interview process (Hack Reactor). Coding Dojo also emphasizes their support system. The bootcamp makes teaching assistants available to the students from 9 to 5 each class day, then brings in a second group of individuals that are accessible to the students until midnight (Coding Dojo). Coding Dojo believes that this approach of present partnership and support gives the students every opportunity to ask questions of their teachers (Coding Dojo). </p>
          <br>
          <p>While many coding bootcamps mention mentorship as being an important component of their program, very few offer concrete examples of what mentorship means to them. Bootcamps could be improved by having a staff member in charge of alumni networking and company outreach. This person would be responsible for connecting students to recent graduates or contacts within the tech sector. These contacts could provide useful information and support to the students. Mentorship could be particularly useful to students who are typically underrepresented in the tech sector. Mentorship gives each student an ally who can work with him or her on an individual basis. </p>
