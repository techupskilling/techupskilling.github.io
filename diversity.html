          <p style="font-size:25px">DIVERSITY</p>
          <br>
          <p style="color:#336799; font-size:20px">MOOCs</p>
          <br>
          <p>By virtue of their scalability and accessible online platform, MOOCs appear to be prime candidates for enhancing the diversity of the IT workforce. However, current data indicates that while progress has been made towards engaging underrepresented demographics in MOOCs, there remains much ground to cover.</p>
          <br>
          <p>A study of more than 34,000 participants across 24 University of Pennsylvania MOOCs revealed significant demographic polarization. More than 80% of respondents from the U.S. already possessed at least a bachelor’s degree, while a majority were male and employed. This stands in strong contrast to the U.S. as a whole, where less than 35% of the population possesses a college degree (Christensen et al.).</p>
          <br>
          <p>The current MOOC model (largely self-directed, impersonal learning) will require enhancement in order to better engage underrepresented demographics—a broad category that takes into account gender, ethnicity, age, and geographic location, among other factors.  On the whole, personal engagement—in the form of direct encouragement from instructional staff—appears to be key to success for underrepresented groups in MOOCs. Research has indicated that while individual ability alone is generally a good indicator of success in MOOCs, that relationship is only valid for underrepresented groups if personal encouragement is factored into the analysis (Guzdial).</p>
          <br>
          <p>While the MOOC model is excellent for increasing diversity, in terms of scale, targeted efforts are necessary to encourage and then maintain participation among underrepresented groups. Possible solutions could come from the local level in the form of outreach to community organizations and civic groups that cater to the needs of underrepresented groups.</p>
          <br>
          <p style="color:#336799; font-size:20px">Community Colleges</p>
          <br>
          <p>The general community college student body is relatively diverse compared to other higher education institutions. In terms of race, gender, and full v.s. part time study, community colleges consistently provide an eclectic group of students each year (“Community College Enrollment” 1). Regarding race, the trend of increasing non-white enrollment is expected to increase by 2050, showing that community college student bodies are becoming more diverse (“U.S. Population Projection” 1-2). One of the most significant contributors to this massive diversity is the commonly adopted policy of open admissions. Compared to other non-traditional educational institutions, including MOOCs and bootcamps, community colleges are known to be less selective. This attracts students who may have unique and diverse life experiences to complement the hard skills they might offer an employer. This diversity makes community colleges ideal as potential tech company hires; the tech industry is a greater force for good with more diversity of perspective, background, gender, and representation. Community colleges have a valuable role to play in this regard.</p>
          <br>
          <p>To cultivate a diverse population and integrate their student body into the academic community and student life, community colleges often have “diversity affairs” offices. These offices can work to ensure that general student population diversity is translated to tech student populations by increasing awareness of opportunities in tech. For example, although 61% of all community college students are female, within the STEM fields, male students outnumber female students by a ratio of 3:1 (“Community College Enrollment” 1, Packard et al. 129).</p>
          <br>
          <p>Community colleges can also work to increase the diversity of their technology teaching staff, providing a more inclusive environment to attract students these programs. Currently, the diversity of teaching staff does not reflect the diversity of the student population. Community colleges could address this by increasing interactions between students and the departments of diversity affairs, or they could make a stronger effort to hire more faculty and staff from underrepresented populations and backgrounds (“Staff Employment Distribution” 1). </p>
          <br>
          <p style="color:#336799; font-size:20px">Coding Bootcamps</p>
          <br>
          <p>While coding bootcamps have potential to bring more diversity to the technology industry, they currently reflect some of the larger diversity challenges faced by the technology industry. Course Report recently published a report on the demographics of graduates from 48 programming schools. The survey found that the majority of students are male, have bachelor’s degrees, and are white (Course Report). Diversity data released recently by major technology companies suggest that white males make up the majority of the employees (Fortune), and statistics regarding coding bootcamps demographics reflect that broader reality to a large extent. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Many bootcamps are working to increase the diversity of their student body, though the variation in target audience and intended educational role of bootcamps will require a range of possible mechanisms to address diversity. For instance, the primary aim of Codeup, according to CEO Michael Girdley, is to make computer science more accessible to underrepresented minorities, who comprise 91% of their classes (Wired). In a similar vein, Code Fellows’s coding bootcamp is directed exclusively at women (GeekWire). Many other bootcamps address a more general target audience.</p>
          <br>
          <p>One general action all bootcamps can take is to offer scholarships to help support a more socioeconomically and racially diverse student body. Many bootcamps offer scholarships for women (Thinkful). Similar such scholarships are available to support those from socioeconomically challenged backgrounds (Eggleston). </p>
          <br>
          <p>However, bootcamps must take steps beyond scholarships in the long term. In a blog post on their website, General Assembly notes several such steps in connection with their recent Opportunity Fund, including deeper engagement with the companies offering financial backing regarding accepting more diverse employees (General Assembly). Schwartz also mentioned in an interview with the authors that in order to accommodate those of diverse educational backgrounds, curriculum restructuring would be another step; general academic background acquired through a four-year degree cannot be relied upon (Schwartz).</p>
          <br>
          <p>While each bootcamp has different goals and circumstances, taking steps to increase diversity across all bootcamps, through accessibility and proactive measures, is important not only to improve bootcamps but also because it has important implications for diversity in the technology sector more broadly. Bootcamps send graduates into the workforce quickly and immediately, so, as researcher Liz Eggleston argues, bootcamps’ “approach to recruiting and retaining students from underrepresented backgrounds may quickly start to define, and potentially diversity, the landscape of the tech industry” (Eggleston).</p>
