TECH UPSKILLING: ADDRESSING THE IT SKILLS GAP THROUGH MOOCS, CODING BOOTCAMPS, AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES


This project assesses the value and role of short-term education options, including coding bootcamps, massively open online courses (MOOCs), and community colleges, in addressing the IT skills gap. In anywhere from eight weeks to two years, these programs promise to provide students with IT and coding skills to prepare them for employment in the technology industry. Likewise, these programs contribute to growing demand for talent in the technology industry.
 

Our research covers the major areas where local and federal government, the technology industry, non profits, and educational institutions can work together to expand the accessibility of upskilling programs to a diverse range of candidates and make them more reliable. We highlight what we believe to be the greatest challenges moving forward, including methods of financing programs; streamlining the hiring process for graduates, increasing their diversity, and maximizing opportunities for effective mentorship. We also recommend collaborative solutions and share best practices we have uncovered from the field.
 

The introduction of MOOCs and coding bootcamps as well as innovations in community college offerings represent a new format for tech education catering to an expansive sector and flexible workplace offered by the rapidly expanding technology industry. As these programs grow in demand and become more established, we find the major challenge they will need to overcome as their commitments and offerings to students and their role and purpose in the eyes of the tech industry. While older, established 4-year bachelorâ€™s and advanced degree programs carry expectations of particular reputation and student outcomes, newer programs have yet to carve out a defined space for themselves in the education marketplace.
 

Thus, as they expand their presence and develop their role, we argue that these programs must focus on making their educational options more accessible in terms of cost and structure and more reliable in terms of the skill level and job prospects of their students.
